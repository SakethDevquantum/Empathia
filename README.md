# ü§ó Empathia ‚Äî Your Empathy Assistant

Empathia is an **AI-powered empathetic counseling assistant** built with:
- **Streamlit** for the frontend UI
- **FastAPI** for the backend
- **LangChain** (with Ollama) for model orchestration
- **Chroma** for storing system prompts and enabling prompt retrieval

It is designed to provide **compassionate, empathetic responses** while still being able to answer general queries (math, factual questions, etc.).  
When answering non-empathy topics, it always reminds the user that it is specifically trained to **help people through sadness, grief, and loneliness**.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Empathetic Conversations**: Responds in a supportive, counselor-like tone (e.g., *"I‚Äôm sorry to hear that, you‚Äôve come this far, you deserve peace"*).
- **Safe Handling of Crisis Queries**: For suicidal or violent thoughts, it:
  - Never says *‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help with that.‚Äù*
  - Provides comforting words
  - Encourages seeking help
  - Suggests reaching out to **counselors, doctors, or the nearest police station**
- **General Queries Supported**: Can still answer math, coding, or factual questions, but always ends with a gentle reminder of its true role (*"I am Empathia, trained to guide those in grief"*).
- **Session-Based Chat**: Each user gets a unique session so their chat history is maintained during the conversation.
- **Persistent Knowledge Base**: System prompts are stored in Chroma DB and retrieved contextually based on user queries.
